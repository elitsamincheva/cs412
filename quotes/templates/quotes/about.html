    <p>Angela Davis is a revolutionary scholar, activist, and abolitionist. A former member of the
        Communist Party and affiliated with the Black Panthers, she was placed on the FBI’s Most Wanted
        List in 1970 and later acquitted. Her work spans philosophy, feminism, and prison abolition,
        emphasizing intersectionality and systemic change.</p>

    <p>Davis critiques carceral feminism, linking the 1994 crime bill to mass incarceration, and advocates
        for abolishing prisons and reallocating resources toward social justice. She stands for collective
        liberation, racial and gender justice, and dismantling oppressive systems through radical imagination
        and activism.</p>

    <blockquote>
        “If one does not engage in the ongoing work when such a moment arises, we cannot take advantage
        of the opportunities to change.” — Angela Davis
    </blockquote>



    <h2>About the Creator</h2>
    <p>I am a senior studying Computer Science at Boston University and currently enrolled in CS412. This quotes web app
        is a course project to display quotes from famous figures.</p>
    <p>I chose Angela Davis because her work in activism and social justice really resonates with me. Her emphasis on
        challenging systems of oppression, particularly around race, gender, and the prison system, felt like an
        important message to highlight. By showcasing her quotes, I hope to share her revolutionary ideas.</p>
